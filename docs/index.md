# About

Unnamed Blocks is my take on a block based programming language. MIT, Berkeley, and more universities have created this form of visual language. These however are really slow and have countless limitations. Unnamed Blocks strives in 2 key points: To offer advanced features while still being simple to use, and performance. Modding has also been a large part of Unnamed Block's development. Every block and most runtime functionality is built into `VinMod`, Unnamed Block's primary vanilla mod.
